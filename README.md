👋 Hey, I'm Uttkarsh .
</h1>
<p align = "center">
<b>I write code, chase bugs, and occasionally find meaning in the chaos.</b></p>

Currently a sophomore at IIT Roorkee building across Web, Blockchain, and sometimes somewhere in between. I like working on things that either **break stuff**, **connect systems**, or **make people say “oh that’s cool”**.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Building full-stack apps with **Node**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **React**
- Creating smart contracts and Web3 dApps using technologies like **Solidity, Foundry, Chainlink** and **ethers.js** 
- Brushing up on **Data Structures and Algorithms** with **C++**

**P.S:**  Running on pure chaos and just enough coffee to fake stability.
